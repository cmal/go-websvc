* Demo Go http server

** features

   - [X] django like template
   - [X] csrf protection
   - [X] express like http-router

** run

   $ mkdir public/

add js/css files there,

   $ go run server.go

(if you use OS X, click "Accept" in the popup window)

in OS X:

   $ open http://localhost:3010

You will see "/".

   $ open http://localhost:3010/hello/cmal

You will see "Hello World! cmal!".

   $ open http://localhost:3010/app

and you will see the html page rendered by `pongo2` template renderer.

(the stylesheets and javascript files in this template are used by me,
to run a SPA app. You may want to modify this file and create your own template.)
